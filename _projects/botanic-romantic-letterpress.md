Botanic Romantic is an online foraging guide and interdisciplinary art project which celebrates the wonder of seemingly mundane or weedy yet edible plants. I started it during an interdisciplinary art residency on the grounds of the former Kirkbride State Hospital in Fergus Falls (in Otter Tail County, Minnesota) in spring 2017. 

The five designs shown here were created for a limited run of 500 letterpress coasters, which were printed in West Saint Paul (at my uncle's wonderful print shop, Old Printing). 

They can also be spotted on the accompanying Botanic Romantic website >>
