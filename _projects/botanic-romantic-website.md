Botanic Romantic is an online foraging guide and interdisciplinary art project which celebrates the wonder of seemingly mundane or weedy yet edible plants. It began as a creative placemaking project as part of the Hinge Arts at the Kirkbride program â€” a community development initiative and artist residency hosted on the grounds of the former Kirkbride State Hospital in Fergus Falls, Minnesota. 

In addition to the website, the project has included a limited run of 500 letterpress coasters, a pop-up bar serving free foraged beverages, and an "art of weeds" class where storytelling and design thinking exercises were juxtaposed with horticultural education and lore.
