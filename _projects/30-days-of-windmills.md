My perspective as a designer has often been informed by a love of typography and interest in storytelling. When I first taught myself web design around the impressionable age of 12 or 13, it was to be able to publish my own poetry. (And to make my Neopets store look cool. Let’s be honest.)

I've since gained several years of experience as an editor and writer. And storytelling is still an interesting concept to me — but in 2016, I wanted to branch out. 

I challenged myself to create an illustration of a windmill every day. It felt simple, yet iconic. 

To focus the project further, I decided to only draw silhouettes of windmills. Soon enough, I discovered that it’s pretty hard to continue to draw new silhouettes of classic shapes. So I began to make windmills that were increasingly conceptual.

There were also, unfortunately, windmills intended to represent historical forms that quite spectacularly resembled something else. I tried to make four different iterations to prove to myself that I could illustrate a non-offensive version of it. I failed. (These are, for your benefit, not included below.)

After a little over a month of countless Google image searches, and numerous experimental design concepts (not least of which was “What would a Christmas sweater look like as a windmill?”), I decided that it was time to finish the project and move on to other work.

So without further note, here's twenty-five more windmills:
