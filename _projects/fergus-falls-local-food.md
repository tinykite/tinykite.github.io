Fergus Falls is a small town (population 13,138) in West Central Minnesota. It is also, notably, the county seat of Otter Tail County and the home of a 150-foot tall sculpture named Otto the Otter. I had the pleasure of living there for two months in spring 2017, while participating in the community development and artist residency program known as Hinge Arts at the Kirkbride.

My residency concluded at the end of May, but my enthusiasm for producing unconventional community engagement projects in town certainly hasn't.

In September, Springboard for the Arts invited me to illustrate a totebag that would be given to participants who successfully foraged ingredients from local businesses in a city-wide picnic scavenger hunt.
