<h1 class="article__title">Hello, I'm Dakota</h1>
<p class="article__intro">Iâ€™m a designer who codes, driven by a deep love of type, technology, and storytelling.</p>
<p>I spent the first several years of my career as a writer and editor for magazines that
include <em>American Craft</em>, <em>Yoga International,</em> <em>Monkeybicycle,</em> and <em>Paper Darts.</em> I believe
my publishing background helped me develop a compassionate, human-oriented mindset. And I love looking for ways to apply it to inclusive digital experiences.</p>
<p>
Fun fact: I'm also a third-generation letterpress printer. And in the past, I've used letterpress as a medium for everything from
<a href="/portfolio/botanic-romantic-letterpress/">telling jokes</a> about commonly ignored plants to professing my love of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BKOaUgCgtkD/">Beyonce lyrics</a>.
