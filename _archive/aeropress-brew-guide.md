Quick, unfussy guide to making Aeropress coffee. Written using my own personal notes and the recipe barista pro [Paulina Miczka](http://www.instagram.com/panda_brews) used to win the 2017 [World Aeropress Championships](https://www.worldaeropresschampionship.com). It's a one-off project for now, but I think it'd be fun to create a series of manual brewing guides.

I decided to create this one after lending a coworker my own Aeropress and finding out that it's fairly awkward to rely on other, existing brew guidesâ€”

Many rely on real-estate-hogging illustrations, photos, and/or videos to demonstrate the more complex aspects of the coffee-making process. Which is totally fun to look at, but doesn't necessarily help in the moment.
