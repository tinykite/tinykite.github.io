Botanic Romantic is an [online foraging guide](http://www.botanicromantic.com) and interdisciplinary art project which celebrates the wonder of seemingly mundane or weedy yet edible plants. It began as a creative placemaking project as part of the Hinge Arts at the Kirkbride program — a community development initiative and artist residency hosted on the grounds of the former Kirkbride State Hospital in Fergus Falls, Minnesota.

In addition to the website, the project has included a limited run of 500 letterpress coasters, a pop-up bar serving free foraged beverages, and an “art of weeds” class where storytelling and design thinking exercises were juxtaposed with horticultural education and lore.

The five designs below were created for a limited run of 500 letterpress coasters, which were printed in West Saint Paul at Old Printing.
