<h1>Brew Guide: Aeropress</h1>

<img src="/assets/img/Aeropress-2.png">

<p>The Aeropress might not seem romantic. It’s plastic. It comes with a perplexing number of accessories. But it’s also remarkably compactable; nigh unbreakable; and the coffee spoon it comes with can be used as a substitute scale in a pinch.</p>

<p>This all makes it perfect for anyone who wants a better cup of coffee with minimum effort. Or the adventurous soul who wants to drink coffee outdoors, on a camping trip, or an extended road trip.</p>

<p>The following recipe has been adapted from Paulina Miczka's winning entry into the 2017 World Aeropress Championships. With it, you can make a coffee concentrate that can be tailored (e.g. watered down) to the strength you prefer. It can also be extracted over ice, for cold coffee!</p>

</ul>
</div>

<h2>Step 1: Prep</h2>
<time>0:00 - 0:00</time>
<p>Grind 35 grams of coffee. (No scale? A full Aeropress scoop is approximately 17 grams, or 2 tablespoons)</p>
<p>Setup your Aeropress on the scale upside-down, so that it rests on the plunger.</p>
<p>Heat water to 84º C (~183º F).</p>
<p>Pre-rinse a paper filter in the Aeropress cap with warm water.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Bloom</h2>
<time>0:00 - 0:15 </time>
<p>Start your timer and dump your beans gently into the top of the Aeropress.</p>

<time>0:15 - 0:35</time>
<p>Add 150g of water and start stirring the slurry, continuing until the timer reads 0:35 seconds.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Brew</h2>
<time>0:34 - 1:05</time>
<p>Attach the Aeropress cap and pause for a moment to think about unicorns (or walruses, or the great outdoors) while your coffee brews.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Extract</h2>
<time>1:05 - 1:35</time>
<p>Gently flip the Aeropress onto your favorite mug, and slowly begin pressing down on the plunger.</p>

<p>After 30 seconds of slow pressing, add 160-200g of water to the extracted coffee concentrate. Enjoy!</p>
