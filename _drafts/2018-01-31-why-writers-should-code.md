title: "Why Coding Matters to Publishing"
description: "Should writers and editors code? Absolutely: and it matters how." 
---
I’m a writer and designer who codes. I’m passionate about finding creative ways in which other creatives can feel just as comfortable coding as I do. I think it’s a really valuable asset to career development. And not necessarily for more obvious reasons: for example, to be able to customize a portfolio or feel more capable contributing to an organizational website.

These are valuable reasons for wanting to learn web fundamentals. But there is another, less sexy reason. 

In the past twelve months alone, three different influential publications have folded: Lenny Letter, Racked, and Rookie. Mic was recently acquired by Bustle. Glamour (“often referred to as a cash cow internally at Conde Nast”, according to WWD) and venerable literary darling Tin House have both announced they will no longer continue their print editions. And The Great Discontent has been put up for sale.  

When publications like these are retired or otherwise evolve, I know from experience that the future isn’t always bright for previously published work.
