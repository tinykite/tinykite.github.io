I’m a designer who codes, driven by a deep love of type, technology, and storytelling.
{: .article__intro}

I spent the first several years of my career as a writer and editor for magazines that include _American Craft_, _Yoga International,_ _Monkeybicycle,_ and _Paper Darts._ I believe
my publishing background helped me develop an empathetic mindset for the audience of any story: and I'm always looking for ways to apply it to inclusive digital experiences.

I'm also a third-generation letterpress printer. And in the past, I've used letterpress as a medium for everything from 
[telling jokes](/portfolio/botanic-romantic-letterpress/) about commonly ignored plants to [professing my love of Beyonce lyrics](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKOaUgCgtkD/). 

You can find me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tinykitelab/), [CodePen](https://codepen.io/tinykite/), and [GitHub](https://github.com/tinykite).
