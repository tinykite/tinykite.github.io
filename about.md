Iâ€™m a designer who codes, driven by a deep love of type, technology, and storytelling.
{: .article__intro}

I spent the first several years of my career as a writer and editor for magazines that include _American Craft_, _Yoga International,_ _Monkeybicycle,_ and _Paper Darts._ I believe
my publishing background helped me develop an empathetic approach to understanding the audience of any story. And I'm always looking for ways to apply it to the design of inclusive digital experiences.

I'm also a third-generation letterpress printer. And in the past, I've used letterpress as a medium for everything from 
[telling jokes](/portfolio/botanic-romantic-letterpress/) about commonly ignored plants to [professing my love of Beyonce lyrics](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKOaUgCgtkD/). 

You can find me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tinykitelab/), [CodePen](https://codepen.io/tinykite/), and [GitHub](https://github.com/tinykite).
